g(a): $m/s^2$ [acceleration] = gravity at altitude

resultant force = thrust - weight
acceleration = resultant force (Newtons) / mass (kilograms)

as fuel is burned the rocket becomes lighter


p(t) = position as a function of time
p(t)

acceleration(t) = acceleration as a function of time
\[acceleration(t) = rocket thrust - gravity \]

\^{} need to add a function for propellant decreasing (\emph{mass ratio}):
    

\[speed(t) = a(t) + speed(t - 1) \]

speed is a fold over speed (just like position is a fold over position + speed)
but acceleration doesn't contain reference to previous acceleration
